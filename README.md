# 5-DOF Robot Arm â€“ Onshape CAD Project
This project contains a fully modeled and assembled 5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm, built using Onshape, a browser-based CAD platform. Each joint provides one degree of freedom, allowing the robot arm to simulate complex motions used in automation, manufacturing, and robotics research.

# Project Description
The robot arm includes:

Base rotation

Shoulder joint

Elbow joint

Wrist pitch

Wrist rotation

# Features
5 independent degrees of freedom

Fully parametric design

Realistic joint movement using mates

Ready for simulation or further development (motors, sensors, etc.)

# Skills Practiced
CAD modeling (extrude, revolve, fillet)

Parametric design

Joint assembly using mechanical mates

DOF planning and mechanical articulation
